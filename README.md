# DDCO-Hackathon 
*	Design a iverilog code for  ALU, register file  and concatenate Alu â€“Reg  for :
*	8 bit processor which will take 2 bit op code to perform only logical (and ,or, nand ,nor) operation
*	Memory should have 8 register of each   size of eight bit and save the result in one of the register and perform read operation to know the output.
